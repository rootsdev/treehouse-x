# Introduction

This was one of the hackathon projects in RootsTech 2016.
As such, it will probably make little progress at first and then be forgotten.

## User Story

User goes to website and submits a `.ged` file.
The submit-server converts (as much of that as possible) to gedcom-x and stores it in a DB.

A (separate?) server serves the file using the gedcom-x RS specification.
